# Reflection
# The most challenging part of the project for you.
The challenging part of this project was planning. It's easier to keep writing all the logics and mapping in one place, but then it will become difficult to maintain and debug.
# A brief explanation of a design decision you made (e.g., why you structured a hook a certain way, how you decided to manage a piece of state).
I desided to write hooks to reuse the codes and context to make props available to all pages. I used useState to manage a piece of state.
